## [Unreleased]
### Added
- BREAKING: [ISS-39](https://github.com/Roboroads/laravel-tinker/issues/39) Tinker consoles are now available under "Scratches and Consoles"
- [ISS-37](https://github.com/Roboroads/laravel-tinker/issues/37) [ISS-38](https://github.com/Roboroads/laravel-tinker/issues/38) When selecting text and running the `Smart Action` a new console opens with your selected text
  - This can also be achieved by selecting text, right-clicking and selecting `Open Tinker Console With Selection`
### Changed
- BREAKING: Every action is now independently listed
  - The default action is now "Smart Action" which will have kind-of the same functionality as you have been using it up till now
- Every action this plugin can do is now individually bindable in your keymap.
### Removed
- BREAKING: Per-project cache (which stored your last executed tinker code)
  - You can probably find your last snippet still in `%Project%/.idea/laravel-tinker.xml` if you really need it!
  - `%Project%/.idea/laravel-tinker.xml` can be deleted otherwise.
