        ## Suggesting a feature
        
        Thanks for taking the time to suggest a feature! Note that if I won't use the feature myself, I might not implement it myself either (as that is why this plugin exists at all :P). However, if you want to implement it yourself, I will gladly accept a pull request. Also note that I might take a while to respond, depending on how busy I am. Please be patient.
